Downgrading, or commonly known as a rollback, lets you go back to past OS versions. This can be useful and easy to epxloit because newer versions patch many things, which we do not want. There are a very limited ways to downgrade on ChromeOS but first you can help yourself blocking updates (even when you restart your computer). This link, as you know was posted many times on this website <a href="https://caubing.glitch.me" target="_blank">here you go.</a></p>

    <p class="try">If you are on version 120-127, WE RECOMENDD TO NOT UPDATE BECAUSE YOU HAVE MANY EXPLOITS ON THOSE VERSIONS. If you are 128, the exploits are very limited. This is why teachers are so paranoid and constantly telling students about updating computer for a "smoother experience". We can confidently say this is complete BS!!! Anyway, there isn't much to say without giving everything away.
