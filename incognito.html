      About Incognito:

      Here is some things about Incognito and why it is SO good. Firstly, Incognito is not visible on any managed extensions, such as, lets say, Lightspeed. If you have an incognito window open, they will simply see your regular tabs or, if you don't have any regular tabs open, your wallpaper.

ㅤㅤIncognito obviously show up on your browsing history, but the big thing is that since there are no extensions pre-installed onto incognito, every site is unblocked. With this in mind, if you go onto a certain website, you have the key to download any app you can think of. Obviously, this is very powerful, so we have securly kept these sites encrypted.

ㅤㅤIf you are interested in this, you must first check to see if you CAN access incognito.
